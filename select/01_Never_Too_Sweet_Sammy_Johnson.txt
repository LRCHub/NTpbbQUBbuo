Got people to see
And things to do (woah-oh)
'Cause working hard is all I know
I got my eye on the prize
Never compromised oh

Why'd you have to go stand right there
With that big smile
And your pretty hair
I can tell from the way you stare
I got the message

The sugar to my heart
You're that one recipe
Oh that's never too sweet for me
No no

Are we gonna take this to the next level
'Cause I just wanna
Work the middle
Put in work a little (oh)
